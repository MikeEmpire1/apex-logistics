## Introduction

This project demonstrates the use of Microsoft Power Platform tools to implement the business activities and processes of a fictional logistics company, Apex Logistics.

## Apex Logistics Summary

Apex Logistics is a specialized logistics company providing warehousing and last-mile delivery services for large and mid-sized e-commerce companies, such as Amazon. The company handles the receipt and storage of inventory items from vendors, processes delivery orders, and performs last-mile deliveries to customers within its operational area.

Apex Logistics operates a fleet of vans for package deliveries. The personnel includes:

- **Store Manager**: Interfaces with vendors and oversees the warehouse and store marshals.
- **Transport Manager**: Oversees vehicles, maintenance officers, and delivery officers.
- **Store Marshalls (3)**: Responsible for loading and unloading packages from vans, as well as storing and retrieving packages from shelves.
- **Delivery Officers (5)**: Drive the delivery vans and execute last-mile deliveries to vendor clients.
- **Maintenance Officer**: Manages the van keys when not in use, issues vans to delivery officers based on the transport manager's orders, and performs necessary approved maintenance on the delivery vans.

## Implementation Approach

The features of Apex Logistics will be implemented following the Power Platform ethos. This approach supports gradual implementation through small, self-contained apps and flows, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all business aspects over time.

## Project Structure

Each feature will be documented and version-controlled in its own specific GitHub repository. The main repository will serve as the central hub, incorporating each feature repository as a sub-repository.
